# Machine Learning Project

### Project Overview :-

This project aims to predict the Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) for an Auto Insurance Company using Machine Learning regression models. The goal is to help the company identify its valuable customers, improve customer retention, and optimize its marketing budget.

### Project Objective :-

The objective of this project is to build a regression model that accurately predicts the CLV of a customer. The model will be used to identify valuable customers, improve customer retention, and optimize the marketing budget.

### Methodology :-

#### Project Thoughts :-

 step 1.) Data Loading - first step is data loading into Python using the 'pandas' library.

 step 2.) Data cleaning and preprocessing - In this step i have check the null & duplicate values if any, and also i check for outliers.

 step 3.) Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) - In this step i explore the data and visualise the data in every aspects. I do Univariate and Bivariate analysis, i create boxplot,countplot,barplot,scatterplot,distribution plot etc.

 step 4.) Model Training - In this step i do train-test split, first i split the data into 2 parts, one is called trained and another one is test.
 then i go for model building and fit the data according to model. So, various regression models will be tested, including Linear regression, Decision Tree Regression and Random Forest regression.

 ### Conclusion :-

 Random Forest regressor is the best model that reflects good score as compared to other models and also (y_pred)prediction values are almost near by to the actual values.
